# VALORANT-Stat-Tracker

This is a simple webscraper program that searches and displays current VALORANT player statistics, updated by tracker.gg.
The user is able to input a player's RIOT name and Tagline and the program scrapes data from tracker.gg and displays it to the user.

*The player statistics are only available if they have logged in to tracker.gg's to view their stats beforehand.
